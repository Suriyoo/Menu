Section 1
"Not use any println to print out anything" -- actually means to make good use of method's void value.
StringBuffer can't instead of int. It's strict to build any variableï¼Œand carefully with choosing its variety.


Section 2
Make variables private / final when it's appropiate. 
Static method is not omnipotent. Try not to overuse it.


Section 3
Make good use of methods when needed, and do not make the main content too complex.
